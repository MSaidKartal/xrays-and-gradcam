# Classification and Gradient Based Localization in Chest X-Rays/Radiographs

## Introduction
> A team of radiologists from New Orleans studied the usefulness of Chest Radiographs for diagnosing COVID-19 compared to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and found out they could aid rapid diagnosis, especially in areas with limited testing facilities [1].
> Another study found out that the radiographs of different viral cases of pneumonia are comparative, and they overlap with other infectious and inflammatory lung diseases, making it hard for radiologists to recognize COVID‐19 from other viral pneumonia cases [2].
> This project aims to make the former study a reality while dealing with the intricacies in the latter, with the help of "deep convolutional neural networks".

## Overview
> This project uses the [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) as it's dataset.
> It has a total of `21,165` Chest X-Rays belonging to 4 different classes (`COVID-19, Lung Opacity, Normal and Viral Pneumonia`).
